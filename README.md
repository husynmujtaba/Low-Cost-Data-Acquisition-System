# Low-Cost Data Acquisition System Using Arduino-UNO Controller

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a low-cost Data Acquisition System (DAQ) utilizing the Arduino-UNO controller and LABVIEW as the graphical user interface (GUI). The system enables the acquisition of input/output parameters from the field using various sensors, analyzes the data, and generates control actions. Additionally, the acquired data can be monitored through a user-friendly GUI. The project also explores sending the collected data to the cloud for anytime and anywhere monitoring.
